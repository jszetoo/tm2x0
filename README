# tm2x0 #

tm2x0 is a Python package for working with Neoden TM220A and TM240A pick and place machines.

It currently has a script for generating a .CSV input file from a KiCad .pos file through a menu.

It was developed by Adam Wolf and Matthew Beckler of Wayne and Layne, LLC, with no affiliation
with Neoden other than we own one of their machines.

## Installation ##

tm2x0 is a Python module.  You should be able to install it through pip or however you normally install Python modules.  The latest version is at: http://www.wayneandlayne.com/files/tm2x0-0.1.zip

Let us know if you have problems.

### Mac OS X / Linux ###
If you already have special Python stuff set up, use that--otherwise, you can try
    easy_install http://www.wayneandlayne.com/files/tm2x0-0.1.zip
    
### Windows ###
We haven't tested this tool on Windows at all, but it should work.  Try easy_install or pip.

## Usage ##

 Generate a .pos file from pcbnew, through the File->Generate Fabrication Output menu.
 
 Run tm2x0-kicad-convert with those .pos files.
     
     tm2x0-kicad-convert --kicad-file myfile.pos
 
 The general workflow is to assign parts to reels by number, and then configure each reel.
 After that, you export the output for the machine.  If you have reels configured in a CSV
 file already, you can feed that into the program so it will reuse those configurations,
 but you still have to assign each part to a reel.  You can pull in general settings 
 for some package types through the autoset menu.
 
 If you don't specify an output file, or if there's issues writing to the file, the 
 converter will output the machine CSV instructions to the console.

### Example Usage ###

## Roadmap and TODOs ##

* KiCad integration as a graphical plugin
* Python 3 support.
* Increase test coverage
* Test on Windows
* Package Windows executable
* Write Windows documentation
* It might be better if you could get actual reel object for a part, rather than a reel index.
* Be more consistent with reel/reel_number/stack.
* Supporting setting nozzle (head) per part/reel
* Let folks set output filename in Save to File menu
* Document the describe script.
* Add more package types for autoset.
* Create an autoset config file so they're not coded in the script.

Please let us know if there's something on this list, or not on this list, that you'd like to see.

## Developing ##

First, you need the source code.  You already have it if you're reading this.

You probably want to make a virtual environment.  I like to do this in parallel with the package directory, next to the README. (You only need to do this once.)

    virtualenv venv

Then, you'll need to activate the virtualenv.

    source venv/bin/activate

You should see (venv) at the beginning of your bash prompt.  (To eventually exit this virtualenv, type `deactivate` at the bash prompt.).

Next, you need to install the package.  How you do this slightly depends on if you are installing for development or not.

If you want to be able to easily develop on the package *in situ*, then install the package with:

    pip install -e $PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_SETUP.PY

This basically runs `setup.py develop`, which sets up some symlinks so your package stays where it is, but is symlinked into your PYTHONPATH.  This works in and out of a virtualenv.  The cool part about this is that you can edit your files keep working with your source control, and yet it still ends up on your PYTHONPATH so you don't have to be in a certain directory to be able to import properly.

To install the test dependencies and run the tests, run

    python setup.py test

## Changelog ##

v0.1:
 * Initial release.
 * This release was developed primarily while listening to the Diablo 2 soundtrack.
